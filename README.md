This repository provides tutorial code for deep learning researchers to learn [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). In the tutorial, most of the models were implemented with less than 30 lines of code. Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended to finish [Official Pytorch Tutorial](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).

#### Sidenote
Hello, this folder contains some codes on PyTorch Basic. I scripted when i was learning. Feel free to download to learn simple Pytorch.
